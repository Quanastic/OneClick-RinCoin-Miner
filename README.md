This is made specifically for RinHash "RinCoin".

It uses SRB-Miner to mine RinCoin.

To mine, enter your wallet address and click Start Mining â€” that's it.

To stop the miner close the CMD Window that it opens.

The miner mines on the Zergpool EU server. To check your mining stats, go to zergpool.com, navigate to the wallet page, and enter your wallet address there.

For now, you cannot change the server within the app and Rin payouts will follow Zergpool's payout rules.

Please make sure to enter a valid wallet address, otherwise you will not receive your RinCoins.

Windows might flag this as a virus. To fix that, disable Windows Defender or follow a tutorial on mining on Windows.

You Need A RinCoin Wallet To use This.
